		<h1>Mini-Project</h1>
		<h2>Radio Controlled RGB Lighting</h2>

	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
		You will be programming an Arduino called the "Nano". This is an Arduino board with the same microcontroller chip as the Uno you have been using, but on a smaller board. This makes it easier to fit into small projects.
		</p>
		<p>
		You'll use three potentiometers to control the R, G and B levels of a radio-controlled light. Your Arduino will read the light levels, then send them over a radio link to another Arduino controlling the light.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Basics</h1>
		<p>
			Here are the programming tasks that you'll be doing:
			<ol>
				<li>Writing the code to read the R, G, and B controls</li>
				<li>Downloading and installing the radio software library</li>
				<li>Writing the code to send the R, G and B levels over the radio link</li>
				<li>Writing the code to receive the R, G and B levels</li>
				<li>Writing the code to control the RGB light</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h1>Transmitter: Setting up the sketch</h1>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Start a new Arduino sketch</li>
				<li>At the top of the sketch, use <span class="code green">#define</span> to create three pin numbers. RED_PIN should be A0, BLUE_PIN should be A1 and GREEN_PIN should be A2.</li>
				<li>In the <span class="code green">setup</span> function, use <span class="code orange">pinMode</span> to make these pins <span class="code blue">INPUTs.</span></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Transmitter: Reading the controls</h1>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the <span class="code green">loop</span>, create three new variables: red, green and blue.</li>
				<li>They should have the <span class="code blue">int</span> datatype</li>
				<li>Use <span class="code orange">analogRead</span> to set red to the value of the RED_PIN pin.</li>
				<li>Do the same for green and blue.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Transmitter: Reading the controls</h1>
		<p>
			To start with, let's just read the controls to the serial port and make sure the numbers look good.
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Add the <span class="code orange">Serial.begin</span><span class="code">(9600)</span> line to 	your <span class="code green">setup</span> function.</li>
				<li>Use <span class="code orange">Serial.print</span> and <span class="code orange">Serial.println</span> to send the red, green and blue values back to the serial monitor</li>
				<li>Add a 500ms <span class="code orange">delay</span> to your <span class="code green">loop</span>.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h1>Transmitter: Testing the code</h1>
		<p>
			Now you're almost ready to upload your code. First you need to tell the IDE that you're using an Arduino Nano and select the serial port:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Click Tools...Board and select "Arduino Nano"</li>
			<li>Plug in the transmitter</li>
			<li>Click Tools...Port and select the new serial port</li>
			<li>Upload your code and open the serial monitor</li>
			<li>Turn each of the potentiometers. The numbers for each colour should decrease to 0 as you turn them anti-clockwise, and increase to 1023 as you turn them clockwise.</li> 
		</ul>

		<h1>Radio Software</h1>
		<p>
			There is a small, cheap radio transmitter inside your box, and a matching receiver inside the RGB light.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Arduino IDE doesn't come with software for this, so you'll need to install it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Download <a href="{{conf['content_radiohead_zip']}}">this ZIP file.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch... Include Library... Add .ZIP Library. Select the ZIP file you just downloaded. You can now use the radio software in your sketch.
		</p>

		<h1>Radio Software</h1>

		<p>
			We're using very cheap radios and very simple software. Because we're just sending controlling the colour of a light, it doesn't matter if a transmission gets "lost" - the next transmission will probably get through.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's no error checking at all - if the transmitter or receiver turns off or goes out of range, it will just stop working.  
		</p>
		<p>
			If your project needs a more "robust" radio solution, have a search for "arduino radio" and see what you find. Try the RFM69 modules for low power radio, or the very popular ESP8266 for WiFi.
