		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
		You've decided to learn Morse Code! To help you, you're going to build a device that tests your morse code knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
		The device will play dots-and-dashes at you and you'll then guess the letter by typing it in over the serial port.
		</p>

		<h1>Basics</h1>
		<p>
			It's always helpful to break a project down into small tasks. Here are the programming tasks that you'll be doing:
			<ol>
				<li>Writing to code to play the right Morse code tones for a letter through a speaker</li>
				<li>Writing the code to pick a random letter from A to Z and play it</li>
				<li>Asking the user for their guess at which letter it was</li>
				<li>Telling the user if they got it right or not</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h1>Setting up the sketch</h1>
		<p>
			To help you, we've written a file that has all the letter A-Z in morse code. 
			<ul>
				<li>First, start a new sketch and save it as morse_code_beeper</li>
				<li>Download <a href="{{conf['content_morse_header']}}">this file</a> and save it into your sketch folder.</li>
				<li>Restart the Arduino IDE and open the sketch again. You should see the downloaded file in another tab inside the IDE window</li>
				<li>Click the tab to read the file. Each letter has a list of variables (called an <i>array</i>) that holds DOT or DASH.</li>
				<li>We put a zero at the end of the array to mean "no more sounds"</li>
			</ul>

		<h1>Playing Tones</h1>
		<p>
		You'll need to write a new function to play the tone for a letter.
