			<h1>Dive In: Blink an LED</h1>
			<p class="code_along">Code-Along #1</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>
				When you first use a new programming langauge, you write a simple program to 
				demonstrate its basic use.
			</p>
			<p>
				On a general purpose computer, this is often a program to print "Hello, world!".
			</p>
			<p>
				The first microcontroller program anyone writes when learning a new language
				or platform is one to blink an LED.

			<h1>What just happened?</h1>
			<p>The Arduino IDE is a text editor combined with programming tools.</p>
			<img src="image/arduino-slides/01-arduino-text-editor-tools.png" height="500px"></img>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>
				The Arduino IDE is Windows, Mac and Linux compatible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Behind the scences, it uses standard programming tools and code.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to try some desktop programming, try Processing, which is very similar to Arduino.

			<h1>What just happened?</h1>
			<img src="image/arduino-slides/02-arduino-compile-process.svg" height="400px"></img>
			<p>Your code is combined with the arduino library and made into a single file.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>
				There are two main steps involved here:
				<ul>
					<li>Compiling: turning each separate code file into machine code</li>
					<li>Linking: combining each machine code file into one</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Before compiling, each file also goes through a pre-processor stage, which does
				replacement of strings, for example if you have:
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="code">#define LED_PIN 13</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				in your code, the preprocessor replaces LED_PIN with 13 everywhere it finds it. 
			</p>

			<h1>What just happened?</h1>
			<img src="image/arduino-slides/03-arduino-compile-process.svg" height="400px"></img>
			<p>That file is sent to the microcontroller down the USB cable.</p>
			<p>It stays there until re-programmed, even if power is removed!</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>
				The program is stored in FLASH memory on the Arduino chip. This is non-volatile memory, 
				which means it keeps its data even without power. It's normally read-only - you can only
				change it by reprogramming the chip.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other main type of memory is RAM. This is where your program data lives when it's running.
				It's volatile memory, which means it loses all its data when it loses power.
			</p>
			<p>The Arduino also has EEPROM memory which is non-voltatile read/write memory. This means you can
				store data even when power is removed! But it has a limited number of writes
				before it becomes unusable, so you have to be careful!

			<h1>Serial Monitor</h1>
			<p class="code_along">Code-Along #2</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>
				Serial communications are an ancient but still widely used way to communicate between
				computers and devices.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Arduino has a USB chip onboard that acts like a serial port, since modern PCs and laptops
				don't tend to have them built in anymore.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some smaller Arduino boards leave this chip out. In that case you need to buy a cable
				with this chip inside (a USB to serial cable).

			<h1>Variables</h1>
			<p class="code_along">Code-Along #3</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>
				When you declare a variable, you are telling the Arduino IDE:<br/>
				"Give me a bit of memory and let me refer to it with this name."<br/>
				For example <span class="code">int led = 13</span> means:<br/>
				"Give me a bit of memory large enough to store an integer and call it led."
			</p>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<section>
			<h1>Variables</h1>
			<p>The data your program needs to store, for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Score in a game</li>
				<li>Position of a joystick</li>
				<li>Temperature read from a sensor</li>
				<li>Time - like <span class="code">loop_timer</span>!</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>Variable can have different sizes (datatypes). Here's a table:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Name</th>
					<th>Size (bytes)</th>
					<th>Range</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>char</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>Characters e.g, 'A', 'B' or -128 to 127</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>unsigned char</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>0 to 255</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>int</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>-32768 to 32767</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>unsigned int</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>0 to 65535</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>bool</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>true or false</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>String</td>
					<td>1 per character</td>
					<td>As long as you like! (in principle!)</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h1>Assignment</h1>
			<p>How variables are changed.</p>
			<p>What does <span class="code">loop_timer = loop_timer + 1;</span> do?</p>
			<p>It <i>assigns</i> a new value to <span class="code">loop_timer</span>.</p>
			<p>The <span class="code">=</span> sign means "work out the right hand side, then put the result in the left-hand side."</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>
				Make sure you understand how and why a variable gets changed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Can you explain why these lines of code DON'T make sense?
				<ul>
					<li><span class="code">loop_timer = loop_timer;</span></li>
					<li><span class="code">2 = loop_timer;</span></li>
					<li><span class="code">loop_timer + 1 = loop_timer;</span></li>

			<p>If you are using switches in your projects, it's important to know about "switch bouncing".</p>
			<p>This is where a switch doesn't make contact cleanly when it's pressed or flipped.</p>
			<p>It can cause software to think a switch has been pressed many times when it's only been pressed once.</p>
